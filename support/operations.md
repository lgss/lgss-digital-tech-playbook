# Operations overview

## How we think of Ops

!> We don't have a tiered approach to operations and support, there is only the first line support of service desk, beyond that we are it.<br/><br/>Instead, we operate what's known as 'Swarm' support model - work with your friends to fix the problem, our users are our service so if they have a problem, we have a problem.<br/><br/>The goal is not to get rid of the ticket, it's to get rid of the problem and that means resolving the issue.

Support and operations is the most important part of our service. and **It's everyone's job to support the services we build.**

To make sure that we develop to the highest standards, everyone works in Ops on a cycle. This means that everyone experiences the bugs, issues, feedback and new feature requests first hand and can take that experience in to project work to ensure that new design and development does not introduce the same kind of problems.

We treat Ops like a project, this way everyone gets to experience the issues that users face and their feedback. We get to feel their pain and understand the problems they encounter, first hand.

?> If you're not scheduled on a project, you're working with the rest of the team supporting services

## How we handle Ops

As with our other projects, there's a daily stand up, measurements and an owner. Ops is no different.

The owner of Ops is the Operations Lead which, for the time being, is the Digital Technolgies Manager.

### I'm not on a project, what do I do?
1. Attend the [daily call](support/ops-stand-up.md)
1. Open Lets Go Direct (LANDesk) and follow the [guide on how we handle support tickets](support/handling-tickets.md)
1. Pitch improvements to the Operations Lead ([see 'How we improve Ops'](#how-we-improve-ops))
1. Remind yourself of the [two types of work](support/two-types-of-work.md)
1. Learn something new

## How we measure Ops
!> in progress

For each service we manage we measure

* Cumulative flow
  - how many tickets resolved vs created in a given period
* Reason for failure
  - the what or why of the failure
* Service uptime
  - what percentage of time is the service available to be used by users
* Mean time to failure (MTTF)
  - the mean average time between unique failures
* Mean time to Recovery (MTTR)
  - the average time it takes to fix a problem
* Mean time to detect (MTTD)
  - the average amount of time it takes to discover a problem

## How we improve Ops

Operations is as a process of continous improvement.

This means, support tickets and changes come in, we should not just fix them without a second thought. Although resolving the users issue should be the primary goal, we also consider how we can avoid the same issue occuring more than once.

We think of this as 'how might we' questions, for example;
* "How might we resolve ten tickets with one fix?"
* "How might we stop ourselves having to make this fix again?"
* "How might we predict this problem before it occurs?"

?> It's our responsiblity to continously improve services for users, this includes Operations. If you have an Ops fix, speak to the Operations Lead to get it done.
