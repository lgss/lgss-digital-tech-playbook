# Two types of work

There are two types of work in IT Operations.

## Changes (Planned work)

?> Scheduled work or 'Operational changes' are fixed and generally planned improvements that should be tested, communicated and actioned with the most care you can think of.

These kinds of changes are especially relevant to our service because we reuse alot of the features we build across different applications, services and customers.

1. No guesswork. Know the impact of your change before you make it by staging changes in Dev/QA environments like-for-like
1. Changes should only be made when there are people available to test the impact of the change
1. The people that make the change should not be the same as the people that test and sign off the change
1. Changes instigated by suppliers should still be managed by us

## Support tickets (Unplanned work)

?> Support tickets are unscheduled work, they happen typically because something did not behave the way a user expected it to. The overall flow for support tickets is described below and there is [a guide on how we handle support tickets](support/handling-tickets.md)
