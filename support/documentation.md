# Documentation

Documentation for the services we run is [here](http://bit.ly/lgss-support-docs)

If a service or app isn't documented yet, use this [template for documentation](http://bit.ly/lgss-digital-support-docs)

This is so that we keep this playbook as a generic how-to guide and service or app specific documentation, out of here.
