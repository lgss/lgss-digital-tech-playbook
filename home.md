# LGSS Digital Tech Playbook

We have a goal, _**to become the best development outfit in the public sector**_.

We're also a distributed team which makes consistency difficult.

This means communication, support and convention are very, very important to us. Not because we're sticklers for rules, mostly because we like to make each other's lives easier.

Designing digital services is hard enough without making our own work more difficult. So here's to us supporting each other and making this team even more awesome.
