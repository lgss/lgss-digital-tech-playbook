# Version control

For version control we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Some older projects may still use SVN but new projects should all be using Git.

## Commit messages
This is a summarised version of the [guidance from the people behind Git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines), mostly because they're sensible and in our experience lead to better development, deployment and support understanding.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Wrap lines at 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.
