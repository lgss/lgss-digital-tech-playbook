# Code

We have refined our work to use a specific set of languages and tools to build software.


## Languages

If you're writing code, you should aim to stick to the languages below.

### Primary languages
Primary languages have been picked based on our ability to support and develop consistently, current production use and the ongoing trend of the tech industry.

* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Secondary languages
Secondary languages are recommended if it isn't possible or appropriate to use a primary language for some reason. For example; use of a CMS like WordPress for websites or mobile app development on Android.

* [PHP](http://php.net/)
* [Java]()
