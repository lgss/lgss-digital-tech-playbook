# Tech roles at LGSS Digital

The role you play and the job title you have are not mutually exclusive. 

We're all responsible for the work we produce as a team. For example you may not be a 'Tester' by title but we are collectively responsible for testing our work. That goes for architectures, quality assurance, development and coaching each other to get that little bit better each day.

In this section we outline what we mean by each role we might play, what's expected of that role (no matter who you are or what title you have) and also how to get better at playing that role.

If you find something useful, need to add something or feel that an area of this playbook needs to be improved, you're free to follow the [contribution guidelines](../contributing.md) and make updates as you need to.

We are all part of making this thing we have better.
